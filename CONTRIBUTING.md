# Contributing to Superagent

## Architecture Overview

Superagent uses a layered architecture where AI agents operate as autonomous services that charge
for their work via the x402 payment protocol on Stellar.

### Payment Flow

```text
User → Orchestrator (Claude plans tasks)
         ↓
    Orchestrator → GET /api/premium/{agent}
         ↓
    Server returns 402 Payment Required
         ↓
    wrapFetchWithPayment (from @x402/fetch) auto-signs Stellar USDC tx
         ↓
    Retries with X-PAYMENT header → Facilitator verifies → settles on-chain
         ↓
    Server returns 200 + Claude response
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **x402 over custom payments**: We use the official `@x402/express` middleware and `@x402/fetch`
   client rather than building custom payment verification. This ensures compatibility with the x402
   ecosystem.

2. **Budget enforcement in the orchestrator**: The orchestrator checks `totalSpent + cost > budget`
   before each agent call. If exceeded, the agent is skipped. This demonstrates programmable
   spending policies.

3. **Dual payment mode**: The system attempts x402 USDC payments first, then falls back to XLM
   direct transfers. Both produce real, verifiable on-chain transactions.

4. **SSE for real-time updates**: Server-Sent Events stream every orchestration event to the
   dashboard, giving users real-time visibility into agent activity and payments.

### Adding a New Agent

1. Add the agent definition in `src/agents/registry.js`
2. Add the service function in `src/agents/services.js`
3. Add the premium endpoint in `src/server.js` (both middleware config and route handler)
4. Map the agent ID to its endpoint in `src/agents/orchestrator.js`

### Running Tests

```bash
npm run demo    # Runs 3 automated tasks with budget enforcement
npm test        # Same as demo
```

### Security Hygiene

- Never commit `.env` or generated wallet secrets.
- Use placeholders only in `.env.example`.
- Before every push, run `git diff --staged` and verify no keys are present.
- If a secret is exposed, rotate it immediately.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full secret-handling policy and how to report a vulnerability
privately.

### Security checklist before push

Run these four commands before every `git push`. They take seconds and catch the mistakes that are
expensive to undo.

```bash
# 1. Confirm only the files you intend to ship are staged
git status

# 2. Read the staged content line by line — this is what actually leaves your machine
git diff --staged

# 3. Grep the staged diff for common credential shapes
git diff --staged | grep -nEi \
  'S[A-Z2-7]{55}|sk-ant-|AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}|ghp_|xox[baprs]-|BEGIN [A-Z ]*PRIVATE KEY|(api[_-]?key|secret|password|token)[[:space:]]*[:=]'

# 4. Confirm no env file slipped into the commit
git diff --staged --name-only | grep -E '^\.env' || echo 'OK: no .env files staged'
```

Step 3 prints nothing when the diff is clean. Any hit is a stop sign — unstage the file, remove the
value, and re-run.

Then confirm:

- [ ] Only intended files are staged (no `.env`, wallets, logs, recordings, or screenshots).
- [ ] Secrets are referenced via `process.env`, never as literals — `.env.example` holds
      placeholders only.
- [ ] Screenshots, demo videos, and pasted terminal output contain no private key material.
- [ ] Nothing was committed with `--no-verify`; if it was, say why in the PR description.

The pre-commit hook ([`.husky/check-secrets.sh`](.husky/check-secrets.sh)) and the gitleaks CI job
run the same class of checks, but they are a backstop — not a substitute for reading your own diff.

If a secret was already pushed, treat it as compromised: rotate it immediately, then follow
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Deleting the commit does not un-leak it.

### Formatting and linting

This project uses ESLint and Prettier to keep code and docs consistent. Before opening a PR, run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
npm run format
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
npm run setup        # Generate Stellar wallets + fund via Friendbot
npm run setup:usdc   # Add USDC trustlines for x402 payments
npm run dev          # Start the server
```

## Contributor workflow

### Node version

Use the Node version pinned in `.nvmrc` before installing dependencies. This keeps local development
aligned with the runtime expectations of the Stellar SDK, ESLint, and CI.

macOS/Linux with `nvm`:

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
npm install
```

Windows alternatives:

```powershell
# nvm-windows
nvm install 20.19.0
nvm use 20.19.0
npm install

# Volta
volta install node@20.19.0
npm install
```

### 1. Claim an issue

Before writing any code, comment on the issue you want to work on:

> "I'd like to work on this — claiming it."

Wait for a maintainer to assign it to you. This prevents two people solving the same thing at once.

### 2. Fork and clone

Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Superagent-.git
cd Superagent-
```

Add the original repo as `upstream`:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/soyaya/Superagent-.git
```

### 3. Create a branch

Never work directly on `master`. Name your branch after your issue:

```text
docs/issue-44-contributor-workflow
fix/issue-12-short-description
feat/issue-27-short-description
```

```bash
git checkout -b feat/issue-27-short-description
```

### 4. Make your changes

Keep changes focused on the issue you claimed. Run locally to verify nothing breaks:

```bash
npm install
npm run lint
npm run format
npm run dev
```

### 5. Commit your work

Include `Closes #<number>` so GitHub auto-closes the issue on merge:

```bash
git commit -m "Your change description

Closes #44"
```

### 6. Push and open a PR

Run the [security checklist before push](#security-checklist-before-push) first, then:

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Go to your fork on GitHub, click **"Compare & pull request"**, then fill in:

- **Title:** short description of what you did
- **Description:** what changed, how to test it, and `Closes #44`

## Pre-Commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit hooks to catch style and security issues before they reach CI.

### What runs on commit

- **Lint & format** — runs the project's existing linter/formatter on staged files only
- **Secret scan** — blocks commits containing common credential patterns (API keys, private keys,
  tokens)

### Setup

After cloning, hooks are installed automatically via `npm install`.

### Bypassing hooks (emergency use only)

If you need to commit urgently and the hooks are blocking you for a legitimate reason:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "your message"
```

Use `--no-verify` sparingly. It disables **all** hooks. Document why you bypassed in the PR
description so reviewers are aware.
